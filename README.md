## 3. Prepare Phase 
​

### 3.1 Dataset used: 
​The data source used for our case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset is stored in Kaggle and was made available through Mobius.​

### 3.2 Accessibility and privacy of data: 
​Verifying the metadata of our dataset we can confirm it is open-source. The owner has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.​

### 3.3 Information about our dataset:
​These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.
​

### 3.4 Data Organization and verification: 
​Available to us are 18 CSV documents. Each document represents different quantitative data tracked by Fitbit. The data is considered long since each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows.Every user has a unique ID and different rows since data is tracked by day and time.​Due to the small size of sample I sorted and filtered tables creating Pivot Tables in Excel. I was able to verify attributes and observations of each table and relations between tables. Counted sample size (users) of each table and verified time length of analysis - 31 days.

### 3.5 Data Credibility and Integrity:
​Due to the limitation of size (30 users) and not having any demographic information we could encounter a sampling bias. We are not sure if the sample is representative of the population as a whole. Another problem we would encounter is that the dataset is not current and also the time limitation of the survey (2 months long). That is why we will give our case study an operational approach.
4. Process Phase 
I will focus my analysis in R due to the accessibility, amount of data and to be able to create data visualization to share my results with stakeholders.​

## 4.1 Installing packages and opening libraries 
​We will choose the packages that will help us on our analysis and open them. We will use the following packages for our analysis:​
## 4.2 Importing datasets 
Analysis we will focus on the following datasets:

Daily_activity
Daily_sleep
WeightLogInfo
Heartrate
We will considered only these four datasets because they have all information for analysis the business task.
## 4.4 Cleaning and formatting 
Now that we got to know more about our data structures we will process them to look for any errors and inconsistencies.
## 4.3 Preview our datasets 
We will preview our selected data frames and check the summary of each column.
## 5. Analyze Phase and Share Phase 
We will analyze trends of the users of FitBit and determine if that can help us on BellaBeat's marketing strategy.

### 5.1 Users Record for diffferent activity 
## 6. Conclusion (Act Phase) 
Bellabeat's mission is to empower women by providing them with the data to discover themselves.

In order for us to respond to our business task and help Bellabeat on their mission, based on our results, I would advice to use own tracking data for further analysis. On our analysis we didn't just check trends on daily users habits we also realized that just 24% of the users really use their device for their health tracker on a daily basis and 76% of the users wear the device all time the day they used it just for general daily activities which are on Auto-Mode .

That being said, after our analysis we have found different trends that may help our online campaign and improve Bellabeat app:

Recommendation| Description

Mendotory manual weight Entry for every day
Water-resistant
Long-lasting batteries
You can wear the products everyday for better heath recommedation beacuse the more we get data the more accurate and efficient solution will be provided.
